# Open Issues & Future Work

## Known Limitations

- **Detecting in-session commit/abort/continue**: If a user executes `System commit`, `System abort`, or `System continueTransaction` from a workspace (directly or indirectly via other code), the exported files become stale without the extension knowing. Possible approaches:
  - Poll `System transactionMode` periodically
  - Hook into GCI execution to inspect post-execution state
  - Require users to use the extension's commit/abort commands (document as limitation)

## Deferred Optimizations

- **Method-level diffing**: Instead of filing in the entire class on save, diff against the previous version and only compile changed methods. Defer until whole-class file-in proves too slow.

## System Browser

### Multiple Environments
When `gemstone.maxEnvironment > 0`, show environment tabs or a selector in the method categories column to browse methods in environments 0 through N.
